$Clear Shader Cache	Clear Shader Cache
$Clear Shader Cache Description	The Shader Cache is the collection of compiled shaders which replace the vanilla shaders at runtime. Clearing the shader cache will mean that shaders are recompiled only when the game re-encounters them. This is only needed for hot-loading shaders for development purposes.
$Clear Disk Cache	Clear Disk Cache
$Clear Disk Cache Description	The Disk Cache is a collection of compiled shaders on disk, which are automatically created when shaders are added to the Shader Cache. If you do not have a Disk Cache, or it is outdated or invalid, you will see "Compiling Shaders" in the upper-left corner. After this has completed you will no longer see this message apart from when loading from the Disk Cache. Only delete the Disk Cache manually if you are encountering issues.
